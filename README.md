This is a python script that reads finanical invoices. I have started this project as a form of inspiration to help my mother 
that is currently an accountant and has stated that the manual process of typing in information was very tedious and could be automated entirely.

Future plans of this project is to be able to extract text from other invoices with different formats to be versatile. 
Once functionality is completed, I intend to make use of Oracle NetSuite REST api to be able to input entry details from my python script.

Description text extraction is broken due to needing to change the original invoice pdf file, using word, causing format to break.
